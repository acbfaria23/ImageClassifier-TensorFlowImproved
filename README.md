# ImageClassifier_TensorFlow-Improved-
Image Style Classifier using deep learning 

This is an improved CNN for classifing image asthetic styles using tensorflow

Summarizing, this code does:

1 - gets images on folder and append it in a big array.
  image source: flicker groups.

2 - convert images in one big tensor of color values

3 - set cnn parameters

4 - define network model

5 - set a array for labeling and compare each image style
    first version: the styles are noir, bright and long-exposure.

5 - set training 

6 - run the function

This code was developed under the guideness of the college professor Lucas Lattari (github profile: lucaslattari)
